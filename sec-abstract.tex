\begin{abstract}
In this paper I present a tool that automatically generates pipelined, multi-threaded digital hardware designs from HDL descriptions of unpipelined, single threaded designs. I then use this tool to do design space exploration over number of threads and number of pipeline stages for a example RISC processor design over with no additional manual HDL specification beyond the initial unpipelined, single-threaded specification.
