We improve the Chisel automatic pipelining tool by automatically optimizing the placement of the pipeline registers. We do this by backannotating Chisel graph nodes with delay data obtained through synthesis and then using this delay information to optimize the placement of the pipeline registers through the use of simulated annealing.
