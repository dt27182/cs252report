\section*{Course Feedback}
This course was very helpful in understanding the VLSI design tool flow. We have gained significant  familiar with Sysnopsys tools through the labs and the project. The class also presented a good opportunity to learn about VLSI design patterns. We are generally satisfied with this course. One thing that could be improved upon is the extremely long CAD tool run times. It seems unnecessary to execute DC in topographical mode for the labs because we run ICC later. We can also potentially reduce running times by excluding unnecessary design environment and constraints.
